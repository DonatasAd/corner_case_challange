### Corner Case Code Challange

Thanks for joining recruitment for Frontend dev at Corner Case Technologies. We’ve a small task for you!
This is simple Radio widget (you can find PSD and PNG files attached in letter). Can you make this stuff work?
Application Requirements/Rules & Hints:

1. Widget is mostly static -selecting station is the only action available. After selecting station, it should toggle it and display its name at the bottom of the widget.

2. Rest of the buttons should be clickable but it should trigger no action.
Additional requirements & Hints:

1. React.

2. TypeScript or Proptypes (TypeScript would be much more appreciable).

3. Tests (should be covered by tests).

4. Test coverage analysis (not required).

5. CSS Modules (https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

6. Even though the radio station list is predefined - the application should be ready to accept the stations from the backend service without any refactoring.

7. Tests should not fail after switching to receive radio stations from the backend service.

8. Redux Saga or Redux could be used (not required).

9. Transition/motion smoothness would be appreciated (not required).

10. Pay attention to code quality, formatting, conventions etc.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
